# COMMON ISSUES FOR REHYDRA

- screen becomes gray/white after executing
  - after the "Changelogs" window popups press "Okay"

- full ui doesn't appear (settings tab missing elements, missing tabs, etc)
  - executor issues, if you are using a paid executor (awp, potassium, or others) send a screenshot of the devconsole (/console in chat or press f9) with all outputs

- can you add [EXECUTOR] support
  - no nigga

- why [X] feature doesn't work?
  - executor issues, show a screenshot of ur devconsole

- why i can't scroll/see everything on the ui?
  - there is a resize button in the bottom corner of the ui, resize the ui to see it fully

- "why scrept no load ðŸ˜¢"
  - always say your executor and a screenshot of the devconsole, then we can say a cause

- esp lags my game (SPECIALLY ON SWIFT/VELOCITY/AWP)
  - shitty esp loops, ts will get fixed on rehydra lite ðŸ¥€

- is this support for mobile
  - it may work on mobile, but doesnt mean we support it
